# Fibonacci_FPGA

This is a fun project in implementing a SystemVerilog Inverse Fibonacci. The coding was done on EDAPlayground.

The design focuses on outputting the Fibonacci index for any 64-bit number in the least number of clock cycles. If the number is not a Fibonacci number, a -1 is outputted.
